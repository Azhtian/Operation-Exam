     * This function calculates the grade of the player. The grade is based on how many books the player collected and how much time they spent.

     * How it's calculated:
     * First the percentage of books is found for example 0.845
     * Then this number is multiplied by 10 and casted to int -> 8
     * Then every hour the player arrives after 09:00 is deducted from the score, for example if the player arrives at 10, 1 point is deducted.
     * This gives a final score of 7 which gives the grade B
